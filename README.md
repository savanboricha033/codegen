# Code Generator AI with Scratch

Welcome to the **Code Generator AI** project! This repository contains an AI model built using Scratch that generates code snippets based on training data. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this tool can assist you in creating code quickly.

## Overview

The **Code Generator AI** is trained on a dataset of code snippets from various programming languages. It learns patterns and structures from this data to generate relevant code based on input statements.

## Features

- **Statement-Based Code Generation**: Input a statement, and the AI will generate code snippets related to that statement.
- **Customizable Output**: You can adjust the level of complexity and programming language for the generated code.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Scratch-based interface makes it accessible for all users.

## Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: We collected a diverse dataset of code snippets from open-source repositories, tutorials, and programming forums.
2. **Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into a format suitable for training.
3. **Model Architecture**: The AI model is based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and attention mechanisms.
4. **Training**: The model was trained on the dataset using supervised learning.
5. **Fine-Tuning**: We fine-tuned the model to improve code quality and relevance.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open the Scratch Project**:
   - Open the Scratch project file (`Code_Generator_AI.sb3`) using Scratch (available online or as a desktop application).
   - Explore the blocks and scripts to understand how the AI generates code.

3. **Input Statements**:
   - Add your statements in the input section.
   - Experiment with different types of statements (loops, conditionals, function calls, etc.).

4. **Run the AI**:
   - Click the green flag to execute the AI.
   - Observe the generated code snippets in the output section.
